two americans are back safe in the US.and two others had been found died after a kidnapping in mexico
official say the 4 went cross border because one person was scheduled undergo a cosmetic procedure.
there's then caught in the crossfire of two rival groups.
E, over million americans travel to mexico for medical procedure.
how safe is that kind of medical tourism distinct from what happen in this case just in general.
i think a lot of people are going to think twice before traveling to border towns and having this procedure done.
not just in terms of the economic benefit of but also there's person safety after what happening dm last week
but the truth is ,John that we have a level 4 travel for dm for years now.
this is not sth new
it's also true for the all the destination in mexico. and people realizes that it's overall it's still safe travel
in mexico.
there pockets of violence parts of territory that under control criminal organizations where you get caught in the
crossfire like this 4 american did on friday.
and consequence can be fatal.
but for the most part i think,people have gotten used to normalize violence mexico and have fun way to leave on that
Eg,and you touch upon of this topic when we spoke on monday.
but how going to a little more detail if you will are the cartels is it drugs ,is it human trafficking,is it both,how do
the cartels operate there.
it's a combination of everything.they control drug trafficking ,human trafficking,extortion,kidnappings.
and they grow to this immense criminal enterprises,and extremely profitable.
and so how they have this power to corrupt , to buy the weapons.
most weapons they buy some estimates say around 70% or 80% come from the us.
and that allow them to control territory in mexico become so dangerous.
and that's part of what explains what happening in dm last week.what happens every week.
of course this has gotten different sort of dimension and attention because of the fact that 4 american citizen were
involved.
but unfortunately it happens every week to mexican citizen.
and it's never ends the same way
us law enforcement source says investigators believes the CC one of the oldest crime groups in mexico is responsible for
the attack on the american victims.

what happenes if by the ministration deg cater as terise orginization
in practical,turn into what happenes is that us turn force would be allowed to operate in mexico teritery to fight this
what would be then turn the orignization.
there's a lot of bad pred for direct doing as new tar inetervention in american.
i don't think there's a morden precedence what's that look like in mexico.
but i think before taking that steps long makers policy markers in us have to recognize 3 facts.
first the us has the largest illegal drugs and assumption market in the world.
that needs to be dressed public gs
that 70% already gs x mexico come from the us that also needs to be dressed.
the sogo wo and drugs have been policy fired.

she is a global director of workplace research at G which is global design and an architecture firm.
j welcome,so what's the ideal workplace look like?
you know,ideal workplaces is one that have choice and offers employees to pick what spaces actually they work best in.
so it's base like coming together working at teams,both virtually or in a person.
but it's also it's ability to be work alone. to be order to focus without distraction and interruption or noise.
so lots of flexibility really.
exactly.
so what is bringing people back to office.
what's they saying as the prime motivation.
in our latest survey,we actually fount across 9 countries 14,000 office workers.
we found that to focus on my work is now no.1.
why is that i'm not surprised
i right work at home but children pets all of those things.
it's exactly.
you know focus on your work also means individual as with as team and so being able to get work down in the effective
way. but also they want a great experience.
let's talk about that.
so this whole concept of making the workplace a destination. you think about destination holidays.
so what's the elements of the destination workplaces.
you think about it's not a obligation. it's compelling destiny.
so do you think creat the experience that people can get remotely,you know it feel care for as a individual feeling
belonging,feeling like a part of sth special.
and especially from well-being standpoint. it's creating space that feel hospitality in nature .they feel like it's a
fun place to be.
got some amenities right there.
high-end fine fitness ,excellent food,flexibility living room spaces.to all spaces to reflect to recharge to refuel.
and you can get that at home.especially and get it working with colleges in the neighborhood.
you have an enticing workplace.
right.
a destination workplace.
so what do you think this hybrid model looks like in the future.
it's interesting thing.as hybrid new we've been mobile
in fact, we've always working in that office.we've been measureing since 2016
and we thought that the most innovate were in the office about 67% of the week.
now as we measure it.people are back about half their time.
j,what do you ideal need in maximize your productivity.you know what i told this.no.
about 2/3 a week.
the most innovative right back to the pre-pandemic.
let me just ask to you, what's the sweet spots 2/3 of the week in the office of w in the hybrid.
you can't think about full days, you should need to think about it's ideal partial day ,you're in and out the office
,it's also part of flexibility.
because we've spending time with clients ,were traveling.we're doing all the other things, city are open to back up.
and so have been flexibility to do that come and go really work where you were best and take advantage of the amenities
in the neighborhood as an extension of the work.
what's sort of surprised you most about the thinking about the evolution of the workplace.
i think what's surprised me the most is the fact the people say they ideally need the workplace.
community,isn't it?
in a lot of ways to second community.
it is .and i think there was loneliness and isolation that occurred with a lot of people working from home.
and so sitting with you.one-one versus as zoom call
so much better.it worth.
yes i agree.jp 3q
