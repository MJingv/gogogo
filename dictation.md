two americans are back safe in the US.and two others had been found died after a kidnapping in mexico
official say the 4 went cross border because one person was scheduled undergo a cosmetic procedure.
there's then caught in the crossfire of two rival groups.
E, over million americans travel to mexico for medical procedure.
how safe is that kind of medical tourism distinct from what happen in this case just in general.
i think a lot of people are going to think twice before traveling to border towns and having this procedure done.
not just in terms of the economic benefit of but also there's person safety after what happening dm last week
but the truth is ,John that we have a level 4 travel for dm for years now.
this is not sth new
it's also true for the all the destination in mexico. and people realizes that it's overall it's still safe travel
in mexico.
there pockets of violence parts of territory that under control criminal organizations where you get caught in the
crossfire like this 4 american did on friday.
and consequence can be fatal.
but for the most part i think,people have gotten used to normalize violence mexico and have fun way to leave on that
Eg,and you touch upon of this topic when we spoke on monday.
but how going to a little more detail if you will are the cartels is it drugs ,is it human trafficking,is it both,how do
the cartels operate there.
it's a combination of everything.they control drug trafficking ,human trafficking,extortion,kidnappings.
and they grow to this immense criminal enterprises,and extremely profitable.
and so how they have this power to corrupt , to buy the weapons.
most weapons they buy some estimates say around 70% or 80% come from the us.
and that allow them to control territory in mexico become so dangerous.
and that's part of what explains what happening in dm last week.what happens every week.
of course this has gotten different sort of dimension and attention because of the fact that 4 american citizen were
involved.
but unfortunately it happens every week to mexican citizen.
and it's never ends the same way
us law enforcement source says investigators believes the CC one of the oldest crime groups in mexico is responsible for
the attack on the american victims.

what happenes if by the ministration deg cater as terise orginization
in practical,turn into what happenes is that us turn force would be allowed to operate in mexico teritery to fight this
what would be then turn the orignization.
there's a lot of bad pred for direct doing as new tar inetervention in american.
i don't think there's a morden precedence what's that look like in mexico.
but i think before taking that steps long makers policy markers in us have to recognize 3 facts.
first the us has the largest illegal drugs and assumption market in the world.
that needs to be dressed public gs
that 70% already gs x mexico come from the us that also needs to be dressed.
the sogo wo and drugs have been policy fired.
