- as he walked ,the man came across a monk who was sitting by the side of pass,deep in meditation
- the man stopped and asked the monk if he knew where the shaman could be found
- the monk opened his eyes and looked at the man
- the shaman you seek you see is not far,he said
- but be careful ,for there's a tigers in these woods ,he is *fierce* and unpredictable,and you must be on your *guard*
- then man thanked the monk and continued on his way,keeping a sharp eyes out for the tiger
- *eventually*,he came across the shaman who welcome him warmly and offered to help with his aliment
- but just as the shaman was about to begin his heal *ritual* ,the man heard the loud *growl*
- turning around ,he saw the tiger emerging from the bush,its eyes fixed on him
- the man *panicked* and ran,dropping his bag as he *fled*
- but the shaman seeing the man's *distress* ,understood what was happening
- he knew the tiger was not after the man ,but after the bag,inside the bag was a piece of meat,that the man had brought
  as an offering for the shaman
- the shaman quickly *threw* the bag towards the tiger who *pounced* on it eagerly
- as the tiger *feasted* on the meat,the shaman turned to the man and smiled
- you see,he said,it was all a misunderstanding,the tiger was never after you ,it simply wanted the food that you're
  carrying
- the man was *stunned* ,he has been so *caught* up his own fear and anxiety ,that he has completely misunderstood the
  situation
- but the shaman was *resonated* with him ,and he began to see how his own *perceptions* and believe, has shaped the
  experience
- and so ,the man left forest with a newfound understanding of teachings of the buddha
- he realized that our experiences are shaped by our *perceptions*,and that's only by *letting* go, of our *
  preconceived*
  motions and *biases*,we can truly see the world as it is
- he also understood the importance of compassion and empathy
- for his only through shaman understanding and quick thinking,he was able to avoid a *potentially* danger situation
- as he walked away ,the man felt a sense of peace and *enlightenment* ,but he had never experienced before
- and he knew ,he would carry this lesson with him for the rest of his life
- you see life in your life
- your experience are shaped by how you interpret and understand the world around you
- it's important to let it go if your *preconceieved* notions and biases
- to see the things as they truly are

  an open *compassionate* heart

narcissism
---

- do you know that there're many types of *narcissism*
- because we're so used to that glaringly obvious *displays* of *overt* narcissist who are of *attention-seeking* loud
  and in you *face*
- it's easy to overlook other types of *narcissism* , *particularly* that kind or the *covert* *narcissism* to avoid me
  fooled by their *outwardly* kind nature
- what's the kind *narcissism*?
- kind *narcissists* describe those who have the general quality of narcissism such as a lack of empathy or desire for
  attention but who come *off* nice understanding thoughtful
- there's still self-serving,and will approach things by looking at what and who they can use to benefit themselves the
  most
- and because of the *appearance* they put up ,it's often difficult to *notice* and realize that you're really dealing
  with a *narcissist*
- even if you realize, it maybe too late since their *facade* may crack when they can no longer contain and control
  their sense of *entitlement* and *selfish* behaviors , appearance can be deceiving
- so what should you look out for?
- *signs* of kind *narcissism*
- according to tl a psychotherapist ,this type of *narcissism* often manifest itself in a few ways
- including not doing their *fair* *share* of housework,insisting that their needs are more important than your,and
  being resistant and reluctant to spend time or resources on things you enjoy
- perhaps ,they promise that they change or will put in more *efforts* in the relationship,but slack *off* in the end
- kind *narcissism* are the one who know exactly what to say and what to do to get on your good side and convince you
  that what you're doing is good and right
- so if you don't want to get sweet-talked into their hands ,here are 5 things you can do when you with them
- no1. set boundaries
- are you able to tell them no
- *narcissism* often won't care about respecting your time and space
- it's a reason it's important to set boundaries and remain *steadfast* about keeping them
- it's a way to communicate your principles and values and to show them what you are and are not comfortable with
- by remaining *vigilant* about respecting your boundaries ,you also show them that their strategies and *methods* to
  *undermine* or *manipulate* you won't work
- no2.speak up
- are you able to speak your mind when your with them
- *narcissist* will often try to silent you as a way to gain control over you
- by being aware of this ,you can remind yourself to speak up and make yourself heard,because once they know that the
  can't silent you,they may give up on their *efforts* to influence you
- no3. healthy distancing
- one of the best way to avoid *failling* into *narcissist* trap is to keep them at an arm's *length*
- the last time you spend with them,the *less* opportunity they have to *weave* you into their web of *lies* and *
  deceit*
- so if you find yourself around *narcissist* person ,try to slowly distance yourself from them
- no4. get help
- if you're relationship with narcissist and require help ,there are some resouces and therapy *available* ,who *deal*
  *specifically* with *narcissism* abuse ,find a mental *health* provider ,or  *supoort* near you
- that deals with this topic if you feel like you need it
- have you ever interact with *narcissist* before?

factory
---

- once upon a time,there was a young man who worked at a factory
- his mentor,an old *technician*,*taught* him to talk less do more ,and never stop developing his skills, *in every*
  aspect of *factory's* operation
- ten years later,the old man retired and the young man became *technician* himself
- he continued to do his work with same dedication and diligent as he was *taught*
- one day ,he visited his mentor
- the old man *saw* that he seemed unhappy and asked what was *troubling* him
- the young man *signed* and *poured* his heart out
- i have been following in your instructions exactly *all* these years
- no matter what i worked on ,i keep quiet and focus on the job
- i know i've done good work at factory and have learned all the skills that can be learned there
- what i don't understand is that the guys who don't have my experience or capability have all be promoted while i'm
  still making as little as i did before when i was your *apprentice*
- the old man asked are you positive that you've become *indispensable* to the factory
- the young man nodded yes
- the old man *paced* back and *forth* to think
- after a while ,he turned to the young man, you must request a day off using whatever reason you like ,it's time for
  you to give yourself a break
- the young man was surprised by this advice
- but the more he thought about it,the more it makes sense
- he thanked his teacher and left quickly to make a *time-off* request
- when he return to work after his day off,the manager called him into the office to tell him that things did not go
  well in the factory while he was gone
- others encountered many problems that normally that would be handled by him and he had no idea how to solve them
- realizing his importance ,the manager decided to promote him to the position of senior *technician* to thank and
  encourage him to keep up his good work
- the young man was grateful for his mentor's wisdom
- surly he thought,this was a secret to success
- from that point on ,whenever the young man felt like he *deserved* more than what he was getting,he would task a day
  off,when he came back the next day ,the situation would improve to his satisfaction
- this *pattern* continued for months
- one day,the young man found that he was blocked from going into the factory ,much to his shock ,he found out his
  employment was *terminated*
- he could not believe it
- not knowing what else to do ,he went back to see his mentor to try to figure out how things had gone so wrong
- why did i *lose* my job he asked with a *wounded* *pride*
- did i not do everything *as* you instructed
- actually you did not,because you heard only half of the lesson,the old man *shook* his head
- you understood right away that no one pay any attentions to a light *bulb* that is always on,it's only when it goes
  off that people suddenly take notices and realize they've been taking for *granted*
- you're so eager to apply this understanding you left before hearing the second half
- second half?
- it began to *dawn on*  the young man that perhaps he made a big mistake
- but what was the second half?
- the man spoke slowly to make his points,the second half is more important than the first ,it's the realization that if
  the light *bulb* go off frequently and sooner or later it'll be replaced with one that one is more reliable
- who wants light bulb that no one can count on to provide *illumination*
- you see in life, in your life
- do you *have* friends and family numbers that your take for granted that they're alwasy there for you
- what happened if one day they're no loner there
- do not wait for such a day,to suddenly realize how important they are
- *give* thanks today for the good *fortune* of having them *in your life*
- also don't let yourself been taken for granted
- but the same time do your work and don't stop everything you do just because it doesn't go the way you want to go
- find the balance and life and life will reward you with giving you the balance back

food
---

- depression and anxiety are now been spoken about *readily* in *mainstream* society
- this means that there are also a *plethora* of researches that discuss how to deal with it when times are bad
- this can range from that grounded in science all the ways to the *personal* *testimony* when taken as fact
- so what actually works?
- one of the more grounded theory is based on diet,not going on a diet , but what kind of food you eat
- *dietary* change aren't *cure* but they can help with the *symptoms* of depression
- the dietary *recommendation* have also *various* *across* studies
- but there were some similarly suggestions that *ran* through most of them
- let's take a look at those because eating smarter has never a bad thing
- no1.healthy *fats*
- that's right,fat can be healthy
- these fats also have *fancier*  names like *omega* sth or *monounsaturated*  and *polyunsaturated*
- where do you find them
- look at *Finns*,they have diet high in fish , chicken and cheese that's low in the bad fat group
- they found this diet help to protect or prevent *middle-aged* *Finnish* man from depressive *symptoms*
- it's magic? no,it's influence reduction at least *partially*
- see, depression is *associated* with *inflammatory* *activation* of the *immune* system and that *wreaks* *havoc*  on
  the nervous system
- what *follower* *then*  are all *icky*  *symptoms* like fatigue,or *chronic*,*discomfort* *antidepressants* have been
  shown to *decrease* *inflammation* too,so maybe wrong on sth
- other places you can *munch* on these good fats by eating fish that have their omega-3 game on point ,like *salmon* *
  tuna* and *mackerel*
- it's just us or do you feel like some *sushi*  too
- if you're more on a *vegan* side of thing,avocado and nuts like *walnuts* and *pecans* works too
- no2.*plenty* of fruits and vegetables
- so speaking of them avocado, *fruits* and vegetables generally do *help* *reduce* *inflammation* in addition to *
  providing*
  *vitamins* as if they weren't *already*  pretty sweet,*fruits* and veges also have another secret weapon *
  antioxidants*
- that's real term and real thing
- keep watching ,we'll *explain*
- depression and anxiety cause *oodles* of stress ,that's stress like any evil entity has *henchmen*
- one of them is called o *oxidative* stress
- *oxidative* stress will *mess* you up
- it's a activity handle you body and ability to *detox*  and repeal itself and can actually change your brain structure
- it's also been link to other *baddies* like *Alzheimer's* ALS and multiple *sclerosis*
- so here's with fruit and *veggie* *superheroes* come in
- that's antioxidant weapon *neutralizes* that henchman's activities
- the henchman causes an *imbalance* and antioxidant restore the balance
- evil plan *foiled*
- you can *gear* up on this with *berries* *leafy* green *beets* and *bonus* dark chocolates
- yep,we said chocolates
- no3,to be well ,have some b12 and b9
- yes,we meet *vitamin* b9 as a *folic* *acid*,not *benign*
- although,if you like the *pun* ,we'll take it
- seriously though,*folic* *acid*  and b12 are both *necessary* for the production of *sarotonin*
- *sarotonin* a mood *stabilizer* is one of the 5 happy *hormones*
- so you definitely want that production going smoothly
- *sarotonin* is produced in the *gut*
- so when you're feeding yourself *folic* acid and b12 rich foods ,they're feeding it too
- so have some *poached* *eggs* ,cheese maybe a banana and be happy
- no4 love the green as *whole*
- did you know that green has *layers*
- you've got the outside *bit* called the *hull* than a  *fibery* bit called bran
- under that this *starches* and *innermost*  bit called the *germ*
- now we get *rid* of the *hull* because it's not really edible and from the bran to the germ ,that is whole *grain* *
  goodness*
- much of shining bright foods we can from the store like white bread all can contain *starches* and germs
- they got rid of *bran layer*
- that gran layer got goods ,like b-vitamin and *minerals*
- well,being inclusive of the green as a whole,is a big part of diets like *mediterranean* and *alternative* health
  eating index diet,and has being shown to reduce the *risk* of depressive *symptoms*
- the *mediterranean* diets includes some of the *previously* mentioned helpful foods ,and consist whole green
  vegetables ,*legumes* *fruits* nuts seeds and species
- no5.consider taking a *amino* acids
- amino acid may sound all sciency but not to worry ,they're simple
- so simple in fact ,they're building blocks ,there the building blocks that make proteins
- we need them,yet our body don't produce them,so we have to eat them
- one of those we need it,but don't make it amino acid is *tryptophan*
- *tryptophan* is center to make *serotonin*
- so you need enough of this,you've heard about it how *tryptophan* is in all sorts of foods from chicken to turkey to
  tofu,so eat up
- foods like *quinoa*,eggs and red meat contain all the amino acid
- so take care of your *gut* and dig in
- and no6,*go* low sugar
- cutting back on sugar has become popular trend nowadays and for good reason
- taking in and overboundance sugar are not only limit colleague production ,but can also impact your mental healthy
- unlike the helper mention before,sugar increase the *inflammation* making the depressive sometimes worse
- sugar's hard to avoid though,because of sort of everywhere
- the good news is that's not real sugar that you have to watch out for
- it's the *glycemic* index you want to keep low
- the *glycemic* index is a measure of how quickly a food makes blood sugar raise
- the gi can even change depending on how food prepared like a *baked* potato having a higher gi than a boiled one
- a quick check on the food *glycemic*  index will help in your journey of helping eating
- you're what you eat,we know this ,and yet we're often forget that our body are not sole instrument but whole *chorus*,
  *opera* and *orchestra* working together
- it's only make sense that what we digest will have a *domino* effect on everything else

horror fiction

  shrieking*
- if this were to happen in real life,will this situation be exciting
- probably not
- but of course, if you know this was just a game, you would know it's safe even though the *scenario* was terrify
- and this is the main difference between real and fake danger
- in his book the *dangerous* edge *psychologist* ma *explores* how people find excitement from *extreme* activity
- he theorized that people raise the level of excitement from *risky* activity by having just enough safety *net*
  activity from being *lethal* or *fatal*
- this is how people can enjoy roller *coasters*, *bungee* jumping or even horror movies

  grandma
- the *narrative*
- have you ever enjoy the scary movie or game even if you typically don't enjoy horror
- what make it enjoyable?

  else is curiosity

tesla
---

- tesla is coming out with all new electric *vehicle* with a more budge friendly price tag
- this's ev is one of the *series* of *nearly* *announced* *models* that'll *soon*  be *available* in the us
- tesla's more affordable next-gen *vehicle* is *anticipated* go on sale next year
- it's starting price will between 25000 and 30000 dollars,currently the cheapest tesla model costs around 43000
  dollars,that doesn't include the *self-driving*  package
- *joining us* now it's tn ,head or lead *equity* *analyst* for global  *autos* at rbc capital markets
- tom,thanks very much for being with us appreciated it
- so,tesla's coming out with cheaper cars
- gm and another *startup* of called of fisker *also* *releasing* *electric* *vehicles* over the next year also expect
  the cost round 30000 dollars
- so why are production is going up and price going down,right about now
- i means this is a actually *anticipated* at tesla capital market *day* a month ago
- he didn't *officially* say it, but he did say that, the costs were coming down by as much as of 50%
- really setting up for what had been *teased* years before which is this *kind* of lower price car
- the reason why now we'll say it's not just them, you *also* see a *volkswagen* ,*announced* they are going to do sth
  similar by *mid-decade*
- the reason why you starting to see more *automakers*  talk about low priced, *vehicle* is *margins* are starting to *
  improve*
  for these electric vehicle
- you remember when they start to come out ,these *automakers*  were losing money on them
- but now as we're finding out, you know,we got government support that *always* help
- but also,*these* companies are achieving more *scale* more cars being able to be produced
- *battery* prices are starting to come down ,especially with some raw *materials* getting more you konw,prices coming
  down
- so that's really why,it's just now we've *scaled* to the point where we can start thinking about kind of the next step
  in the evolution of ev's
- thanks you *hinted* a little bit at this *incentives* that are there for the company from the government
- but this car price as i understand don't factor in the *inflation* reduction acts breaks for people own electric
  vehicles
- i understand that goes as high as 7500 dollars
- who can benefit from this and am i right that you konw,that would be discount on top
- so what would be even less than 30000 to 25000 dollars
- *no* that's absolute right,it's on top of it
- now keep in mind not everybody's gonna qualify for 35000 dollars
- you have to prove you're producing a lot of components of the cars in the us obviously
- so many  *automakers* even don't quality some of the cars
- so tesla we think is actually to best position here,even though they are model free,there is a *variant* that
  doesn't *fully* quality
- but for the most part ,it's on top of the existing price we're seeing
- and the reason why is ev's actually if battery price is coming down ,they actually cost less to make for car maker
  ,it's less part right
- and so for that reason down the *road* ,it's no surprise that the price we'll come down you see more low price
  *variants*
- all right,getting us *closer* to cutting down those *emissions* that target *dates* that the *administration* has put
  forward
- tom ran thank you so much

  relating to others
