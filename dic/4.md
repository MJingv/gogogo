- i've been asked today to talk to you about the urban landscape
- there's two major areas that i'd focus in my talk, how vegetation can have significant defects on urban claims and how
  we can better plan our cities using trees to provide more comfortable environment for slides living
- trees can have significant impact on our cities
- they can make it a bit cooler if it's in the hot summary day in *australia* city or they can make it a bit more humid
  if it's in dry land city
- on the local scale,that's in particular area within the city ,trees can make the local area more sheddy humid,cooler
  and much less windy
- in fact,tress and planting various kinds can be used to make city streets actually less dangerous in particular areas
- how do trees do that you asked
- well,the main different between a tree and a building is a tree has gotten internal macanazine to keep the *
  temperature* regulated
- it's vaporate water through its leaves,and that's means the temperature of the leaves is very far from our own body
