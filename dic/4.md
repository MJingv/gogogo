- there's two major areas that i'd focus in my talk, how vegetation can have significant defects on urban claims and how
  we can better plan our cities using trees to provide more comfortable environment for slides living

  and much less windy

- how do trees do that you asked
- well,the main different between a tree and a building is a tree has gotten internal macanazine to keep the *
  temperature* regulated
- it's vaporate water through its leaves,and that's means the temperature of the leaves is very far from our own body
  temperature
