- good afternoon everybody, and welcome to riverside industrial village
- to start your visit ,i'm just going to give you a brief content of the history of the museum, before letting you room
  about on your own
- i won't keep you long,ok
- now, from where we're standing,you've got a good view of the river over there
- and it was because this fast flowing water,and this set was nature place from *manufacture*  works
- the water and the *availability* of the raw materials in areas like mineral and iron ,and also the bond of local feild
  like coal and firework all make this set suitable for industry from very early time
- water with the main source of power of early industry,and some with the water wize was first established in 12th *
  century*,would you believe
- at that time ,local *craftsmen* first build iron forge just behind the village on the band of the river
- by the 17th since 18th century,the richen rive, support more than hundreds sixty watermills and many of this continue
  to operate willing to 19th century
- but then the steal managing was invented and the rear way came and the century of the industry was able to move away
  and into the towns
- so industry like village this one become very rare
- so that's the history for you

- excuse me,doc json
- may i speak to you for a minute
- sure,come in
- i'm mg
- i'm taking your courses population studies
- right,m,how can i help you
- i'm having a bit of *troubles* with the second *assignment* and it still in 12 days ,
- what's the troubles you're having,is this the assignment question problem
- well,that's part of the problem
- i'm also having ,being having trouble getting hold the books
- i'm being to the library several times and all the books are sold out
- i'd like you should borrow books a bit early
- well,i had a really big assignment doing for another course,i've been spent all my time on that,i thought
- you might get extention of time to finish your assignment for me
- if that possible,but i don't know
- well,yes,it's possible,but extention are normally given only for medical,or compassional reasons, otherwise, it's
  really a question to organize your study,and we don't like to give extention to students who simply didn't plan their
  work porperly
- what did you get for your first assignment
- i got 87 percent
- yes ,you did very well ,indeed,so obvious you can produce good work
- i don't think i need too much extra time ,as long as i can get a whole of some important reference
- since you did so well in t your first assignment
- i'm preparing to give your extra 2 week for this one,so that mean you need to submit about a about a month from now
- 3q
- now ,what about reading?m
- you checkout the journey articles on the list
- no,not yet,they're about 20 of them ,and i'm not sure which one would be most useful or important
- they're all useful,but i'm not expect anyone to read them all,because the number of them deal with the same issues
- let me give you some suggestions
- the article by ah is really worth reading
- right ,i read that one
- you should also read the article by jack,but just look at the part of research methodlogy how they did it
- ok,j,got that
- and if you have time ,the one by r,said very relevant thing ,although it's not essential
- so ok,if it's useful,i'd try to make that one
- now ,the one by m
- i wouldn't bother was that the stage if i were you
- ok,i won't bother with m
- someone tell me the article by cooper is important
- but look at the last part ,the discuss is research result
- and last is fst ,i can't think why i include that one
- this not bad,and could be some help,but not that much
- now ,let's deal with the assignment question
- what's the problems there
- it's the graft on page2
- well,it seems to be a problem
- it's just the bar graph showing the reasons why people change why they leave
- i got a photo copy but the reason of the bottom is missing
- ok,look at the first bar on the graph that indicate the number of people who move because they want more space
- i see ,bar 1 ,ok ,what about the next bar
- bar 2 is to do with people living nearby disturbing them,so they choose to move away to somewhere quieter
- now,let's look at the bar no3,another reason people changes their places of living is because they want to be closer
  to the city
- ok,procsimity isn't assume
- now bar no4 reference the problem when the owner of the perporty won't help fix things that go wrong
- another words,the owner is not helpful and so the tenants move out
- ok,what about bar 5
- bar 5 is about those people who moves because they need to bus or train to get the main of city or to go to the work
- ok,and bar 6
- bar no6 is interesting
- that reason is given quite a lot ,people moving because they want to be in a more attractive neiborhood
- yes ,3q very much

- i've been asked today to talk to you about the urban landscape
- there's two major areas that i'd focus in my talk, how vegetation can have significant defects on urban claims and how
  we can better plan our cities using trees to provide more comfortable environment for slides living
- trees can have significant impact on our cities
- they can make it a bit cooler if it's in the hot summary day in *australia* city or they can make it a bit more humid
  if it's in dry land city
- on the local scale,that's in particular area within the city ,trees can make the local area more sheddy humid,cooler
  and much less windy
- in fact,tress and planting various kinds can be used to make city streets actually less dangerous in particular areas
- how do trees do that you asked
- well,the main different between a tree and a building is a tree has gotten internal macanazine to keep the *
  temperature* regulated
- it's vaporate water through its leaves,and that's means the temperature of the leaves is never very far from our own
  body temperature
- the *temperature* of building surface on the hot sunny day can easily be 20 degrees more than our temperature
- trees on the other hand,remember cooler than buildings because they sweat
- this means they can humidify the air and cool it,property which can be expoit to improve the local climate
- trees can also help break the force of the winds
- the reason of the high building make it windy at ground level,is that as the wind goes higher and higher,it goes
  faster and faster
- when the wind hits the building, it has to go somewhere
- some of this goes over the top and some goes around the size of the building, for things though high level winds down
  to ground level
- that doesn't happen when you have trees
- trees filter the winds,and considerably reduce this,preventing those very large strong gust ,you're also found around
  the tall buildings
- another problem in built up area is traffic noise isn't tencyfied by tall buildings
- by planting a balt of trees,the side of the road,you can make things a little quieter,but much of the viacol noise
  still goes through the trees
- trees can also help reduce the amount of the noise and surroundings,although the effect is not large as people like to
  think
- low frequency noise particular just goes through the trees on there
- although trees can significantly improve the local climate,they do however take up a lot of space
- there's road system to consider, and brunch is blocking windows and so on
- it might that for be difficult to fit trees into local landscape
- there's not a good deal you can do to if you have what we called ,a street cani ,a whole set of high rises,enclosed in
  the narrow streets
- trees need water to grow
- they also need some sunlight to grow,and you need room to book them
- if you have the chance of knocking buildings down and replacing them ,then suddenly you can stop looking at different
  ways to design the streets and to introduce

- oh peter,there you are
- you've been *ages*,what *kept* you so long
- i'm sorry,i'm so late,sl
- you've been waiting long?
- half an hour,
- but it doesn't matter
- i've had this coffee,and i've been reading this guide book for tourist
- sit down,you look very hot and tired
- what would you like to drink
- i'd love a really chilled mineral water or sth
- would you have another coffee
- yes,i'll.the waitress will back in a moment
- why are you so late
- did sth happen
- yes,you know i went to the bank to *cash* some *travellers* *cheques*
- the exchange rate is looking healthy,but when i went to the teller,he told me the computer system is temporary down,so
  they couldn't do any transaction
- they said the problem will be fixed in a few minutes,so i waited
- and i started to talk another guy in the bank and i forget the time
- really
- someone you met in the bank
- does he work there
- no,he was a tourist from new york
- his name is hm,and he've been for a week but he's moving on to germany tomorrow
- his an architect,and he've spent 4 weeks traveling around the europe
- just like us
- he told me the name of some places what we should eat
- great food and not too expensive inside
- oh,he also gave the map of the buse *system*
- and he said he didn't need *it* anymore
- that's useful,pretty his moving on tomorrow
- here's the waiterss,let's order
- do you want sth to eat or shall we just have drink
- well,i'm *hungry*,and we get lots of *sightseeing* to do ,let's have some snakes and drink
- sounds good to me
- well,let's decide what we'll see today


- i guess the best place to start is *cathedral* and then the castle
- what *are* the opening time for those two
- according to the guidebook,the cathedral is only open from 9:30 in the morning util midday
- no,hold on,that's the cathedral museum
- the cathedral *itself* is open morning *and* afternoon
- the castle is just open from 1 to 5,so we can't go there until after lunch
- i really want to spend sometime in the art gallery ,because *they've got*  this wonderful painting by rb , *that i've
  always* want to see
- what else should we see
- the guidebook says the b garden *are worth* spending some time in,they're open all from 8 to 6,so we go there anytime
- i'd like to go to the markets near the river too,but that's only in the morning too
- as well as today and tomorrow,we can see some other places on morning you know
- but i don't think the market would be open , they only open on thursday ,so we miss them for this week
- maybe we should go to the cathedral today,because it's sunday tomorrow when even through it's open every day ,it might
  more difficult to get into tomorrow,because it's church services
- that's true,but the art gallery *isn't* open on sunday *at all*, so we'll have to go there today
- the castle is open every day except monday, so *we're ok*  there ,and the garden is of course only closed at night
- are all the places free or do we have to pay to go in
- what's the guidebook saying
- i think that's a charge for all of them except the b gardens
- and the markets,of course you don't pay to go in
- ok let's look at *our* plan like this,we'll go to see the painting you liked first, the rb,then have lunch, and go on
  the castle after that,then the cathedral
- ok,it *says* here ,the roof of the cathedral look really beautiful
- is that right
- what i really want to do at cathedral is *climb* the towel
- the view is supposed to be *spectacular*
- ok,that'll be more than *enough* today
- and tomorrow let's go to the p garden and have a picnic
- i want to *sit by the*  river and watch the *swans*
- *the* city is famous for them

- so the counselling services we offered deal with any problems arising from your study or in your life outside the
  university
- let's take academic *counselling*
- if you're confused about subjects or how to combine them in your degree then we can *advise* you ,and discuss the
  career you're aiming for,so you can see it all in context
- we can also chase up your *tutor* if you're not getting *proper* feedback on how you're getting on in your subject
- besides help with the academic problems,you may also need personal *conselling*,if you think you've already under
  *stress* ,just wait *till* classes begin next week
- you have to start to adjust to teaching and learning messages,that's maybe unfamiliar to you,as well as the mounting pressure is the deadline for that desent on you
- and of course,you've to cope with all  this  without your usual social network,you know the social context ,family and friends ,you could normally relay on for help
- all of this couse anxiety
- studying overseas can trigger a personal crisis,you may have to left lot of what you might call unfinished business back in your own country ,or may you have interrupt personal relationship or even sometimes break them all to come ,so the students often feel lonely ,unhappy,unmotivated,and unable to concentrate on study 
- or there maybe other things bothering you
- i resident chaplen can offer you special ganden if that what you want or we can put you in touch with communite groups that can provide you with social context and friendship
- what about exam stress
- it effects nearly everyone to some extend ,but especially overseas students like yourself
- there maybe a huge amount family press for you to succeed,if you fail subject or drop out of the course because of it's too difficult,then your self-esteem can suffer
- but it's not the end of the world if you don't pass the exam,i have to reset first year exam appology ,so i can certainly offer you a *sympathetic* year
- anyway exams  fail  can lead to worry changes in the way you normally behave
