- good afternoon everybody, and welcome to riverside industrial village
- to start your visit ,i'm just going to give you a brief content of the history of the museum, before letting you room
  about on your own
- i won't keep you long,ok
- now, from where we're standing,you've got a good view of the river over there
- and it was because this fast flowing water,and this set was nature place from *manufacture*  works
- the water and the *availability* of the raw materials in areas like mineral and iron ,and also the bond of local feild
  like coal and firework all make this set suitable for industry from very early time
- water with the main source of power of early industry,and some with the water wize was first established in 12th *
  century*,would you believe
- at that time ,local *craftsmen* first build iron forge just behind the village on the band of the river
- by the 17th since 18th century,the richen rive, support more than hundreds sixty watermills and many of this continue
  to operate willing to 19th century
- but then the steal managing was invented and the rear way came and the century of the industry was able to move away
  and into the towns
- so industry like village this one become very rare
- so that's the history for you

- i've been asked today to talk to you about the urban landscape
- there's two major areas that i'd focus in my talk, how vegetation can have significant defects on urban claims and how
  we can better plan our cities using trees to provide more comfortable environment for slides living
- trees can have significant impact on our cities
- they can make it a bit cooler if it's in the hot summary day in *australia* city or they can make it a bit more humid
  if it's in dry land city
- on the local scale,that's in particular area within the city ,trees can make the local area more sheddy humid,cooler
  and much less windy
- in fact,tress and planting various kinds can be used to make city streets actually less dangerous in particular areas
- how do trees do that you asked
- well,the main different between a tree and a building is a tree has gotten internal macanazine to keep the *
  temperature* regulated
- it's vaporate water through its leaves,and that's means the temperature of the leaves is never very far from our own
  body temperature
- the *temperature* of building surface on the hot sunny day can easily be 20 degrees more than our temperature
- trees on the other hand,remember cooler than buildings because they sweat
- this means they can humidify the air and cool it,property which can be expoit to improve the local climate
- trees can also help break the force of the winds
- the reason of the high building make it windy at ground level,is that as the wind goes higher and higher,it goes
  faster and faster
- when the wind hits the building, it has to go somewhere
- some of this goes over the top and some goes around the size of the building, for things though high level winds down
  to ground level
- that doesn't happen when you have trees
- trees filter the winds,and considerably reduce this,preventing those very large strong gust ,you're also found around
  the tall buildings
- another problem in built up area is traffic noise isn't tencyfied by tall buildings
- by planting a balt of trees,the side of the road,you can make things a little quieter,but much of the viacol noise
  still goes through the trees
- trees can also help reduce the amount of the noise and surroundings,although the effect is not large as people like to
  think
- low frequency noise particular just goes through the trees on there
- although trees can significantly improve the local climate,they do however take up a lot of space
- there's road system to consider, and brunch and so on
