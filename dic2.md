attraction
---

- what does *mutual* attraction look like in real life
- if you're attracted to someone *and* you're wondering if the feeling is *mutual* *we're here to* give you more
  *clarity*
- no1.direction
- when you think about the attraction you may picture the obvious indicators like lots of eye contract or smiling often
- but did you know that the direction your crushes *is* facing could be indicator of *mutual* attraction as well
- in the article published *on* up journey ab *psychotherapist and clinical director*  at mind by design,says that if
  your bodies are facing each other or if you're turning towards one *another*  often, it's a sign that you're both to
  each other
- the reason for this is *explained* in an article published in psychology today by doc rg ,he pointed out that facing
  the same direction *as* someone shows you're been inviting
- and *it* *encourages* the other person to connect with you, it's also a good indicator that they trust you
- try to *see* if you *notice* the sign in body language ,the next time you watch the *bachelor* or 90 *day* *fiance*
- no2.mirroring
- mirroring also known as *mimicry* is strongly associated with attraction
- according to a study published by ma collage,when you're around your crush,try *paying* attention to their movements
  and compare them to yours
- if you find that you *tend* to *mimic* each other's postures, expressions,*even ways* of speaking ,then you're feeling
  for them just *might be*  *mutual*
- m and collage highlight that *mirroring* or *mimicry* *is* a *affiliative* behavior meaning *it's done to*  build
  stronger relationship with someone
- in other words, your crush *mimics* you *in order to* get you to like them and *form* a *closer* bond
- however,mirroring isn't always intentional ,it can be subconscious changes in the body language that helps people
  build trust and former relationships
- so keep a lookout for this cue in your crush ,they may not even be aware when you're doing it
- no3.excuse,excuse
- imaging your collage *students* ,hanging out on campus with your crush and some friends
- you tell everyone that you have to go to the class ,your crush says ,hi,my class is that way too
- why don't we just walk together
- is that just *a friend gesture* or could they be making *an* excuse to hang out with you
- because the feeling is *mutual*, *while* *one or two*  situations like this aren't enough to tell if  *it* become the
  *pattern* and you find your crush *constantly* making excuses to talk to you or spend time with you and you do the
  same,then your attractions for them could be *mutual*
- according to 2018 study published in psychology *bulletin* ,direct body language like *being* *psysically* close to
  one another, hanging out more,or talking to each other more often than you do with others is more strongly relate to
  attraction than *indirect* behaviors like *mimicry*
- turns out , it just might be easier than you think to tell if you have a mutual connection with someone
- no4.*pheromones*
- have you ever wonder what *causes* people to be attracted to each other right away and experience love at first sight
- according to better help ,this instance *chemistry* usually happens because of pheromones
- pheromone are *chemicals* that we *detect* through our sense of smell
- they influence both sexual behavior and *arousal* which play a big role in the attraction
- depending on your genetic makeup,your pheromone can make you more attractive to certain people
- in the class t-shirt study conducted by wc and collage in 1995, research had *men* *wear* the same t-shirt for 2
  nights *in a row* with *no deodorant or* other artificial *scents*
- than they asked woman to *rate* how each t-shirts smells and found that woman prefered the *scent* of t-shirts *worn*
  by men *whose* mhc gene ,differ from theirs
- according to bbs, that the msh gene is also known as a *immune* system gene
- if two people who have very different *immune* system , start a family together,their kids would have genetic
  advantage
- because they would like be able to fight *off* more types of *diseases* *effectively*,the takeaway from scientific
  perspective ,pheromone can help to tell you whether your crush is a good match for you or not
- if someone complimnets you on and how you smell and you like their *scent* too,this is a good sign that you're
  *mutual* attracted to each other or *build least* on a biologic level

communication
---

- have you ever talk with your friends about the problem only to realize that he just doesn't seem to grasp why the
  issue is so important to you
- have you ever present an idea to a group and it matters with other confusion
- or maybe you've been in an argument when other person suddenly acuse you of not listening to what they're saying at
  all
- what's going on here
- the answer is mis-communication
- and in the some former or others, we've all experienced,it can lead to confusion ,animaciy , misunderstanding or even
  crush a mouty million dollars probe into the surface of malls
- the fact is even when face to face with another person in the very same room and speaking the same language,human
  communication is incredibly complex
- but the good news is that the basic understanding of what happened when you communicate can help us prevent
  mis-communication
- for decades ,researches have asked what happens when we communicate
- one interpertation ,call transmission model ,views communication as a message that moves directly from one person to
  an ,similar to someone talking sth at all and walking away
- but in reality ,this impliscate model doesn't account for communication complexcity
- enter the transaction model which acknowledges that many added challenges of the communicating
- with this model ,it's more accurate to think communication between people as a game of catch
- as we communicate or message, we've received faceback from other party
- through the transaction,we create meaning together
- but from the success change ,forther complication arise
- it's not like the star track universe or some caricter can vocan mind mile , falling sharing froze and feelings
- as humans ,we can't help but send and receive messages through our own subjective lances
- when communicating one person express her interpretation of message and the person she's communicating with,here's his
  own interpretation of that message
- our preception filter continuing shift meaning and interpretations
- remember that game of catch
- imaging it with lomp of clam
- as each person touch as it ,they shape to feed their own unique perception based on any number of variable ,like
  knowledge ,or pass experience, ages, ,race, gender ,asnicity,relation or family background
- simutinancely ,every person inteperate the message they'll receive,based on their relationship with other person ,and
  their unique understanding of semantic and conetations of exact words of be a news
