attraction
---

- what does *mutual* attraction look like in real life
- if you're attracted to someone *and* you're wondering if the feeling is *mutual* *we're here to* give you more
  *clarity*
- no1.direction
- when you think about the attraction you may picture the obvious indicators like lots of eye contract or smiling often
- but did you know that the direction your crushes *is* facing could be indicator of *mutual* attraction as well
- in the article published *on* up journey ab *psychotherapist and clinical director*  at mind by design,says that if
  your bodies are facing each other or if you're turning towards one *another*  often, it's a sign that you're both to
  each other
- the reason for this is *explained* in an article published in psychology today by doc rg ,he pointed out that facing
  the same direction *as* someone shows you're been inviting
- and *it* *encourages* the other person to connect with you, it's also a good indicator that they trust you
- try to *see* if you *notice* the sign in body language ,the next time you watch the *bachelor* or 90 *day* *fiance*
- no2.mirroring
- mirroring also known as *mimicry* is strongly associated with attraction
- according to a study published by ma collage,when you're around your crush,try *paying* attention to their movements
  and compare them to yours
- if you find that you *tend* to *mimic* each other's postures, expressions,*even ways* of speaking ,then you're feeling
  for them just *might be*  *mutual*
- m and collage highlight that *mirroring* or *mimicry* *is* a *affiliative* behavior meaning *it's done to*  build
  stronger relationship with someone
- in other words, your crush *mimics* you *in order to* get you to like them and *form* a *closer* bond
- however,mirroring isn't always intentional ,it can be subconscious changes in the body language that helps people
  build trust and former relationships
- so keep a lookout for this cue in your crush ,they may not even be aware when you're doing it
- no3.excuse,excuse
- imaging your collage *students* ,hanging out on campus with your crush and some friends
- you tell everyone that you have to go to the class ,your crush says ,hi,my class is that way too
- why don't we just walk together
- is that just *a friend gesture* or could they be making *an* excuse to hang out with you
- because the feeling is *mutual*, *while* *one or two*  situations like this aren't enough to tell if  *it* become the
  *pattern* and you find your crush *constantly* making excuses to talk to you or spend time with you and you do the
  same,then your attractions for them could be *mutual*
- according to 2018 study published in psychology *bulletin* ,direct body language like *being* *psysically* close to
  one another, hanging out more,or talking to each other more often than you do with others is more strongly relate to
  attraction than *indirect* behaviors like *mimicry*
- turns out , it just might be easier than you think to tell if you have a mutual connection with someone
- no4.*pheromones*
- have you ever wonder what *causes* people to be attracted to each other right away and experience love at first sight
- according to better help ,this instance *chemistry* usually happens because of pheromones
- pheromone are *chemicals* that we *detect* through our sense of smell
- they influence both sexual behavior and *arousal* which play a big role in the attraction
- depending on your genetic makeup,your pheromone can make you more attractive to certain people
- in the class t-shirt study conducted by wc and collage in 1995, research had *men* *wear* the same t-shirt for 2
  nights *in a row* with *no deodorant or* other artificial *scents*
- than they asked woman to *rate* how each t-shirts smells and found that woman prefered the *scent* of t-shirts *worn*
  by men *whose* mhc gene ,differ from theirs
- according to bbs, that the msh gene is also known as a *immune* system gene
- if two people who have very different *immune* system , start a family together,their kids would have genetic
  advantage
- because they would like be able to fight *off* more types of *diseases* *effectively*,the takeaway from scientific
  perspective ,pheromone can help to tell you whether your crush is a good match for you or not
- if someone complimnets you on and how you smell and you like their *scent* too,this is a good sign that you're
  *mutual* attracted to each other or *build least* on a biologic level

communication
---

- have you ever talk with your friends about the problem only to realize that he just doesn't seem to grasp why the
  issue is so important to you
- have you ever present an idea to a group and it matters with other confusion
- or maybe you've been in an argument when other person suddenly acuse you of not listening to what they're saying at
  all
- what's going on here
- the answer is mis-communication
- and in the some former or others, we've all experienced,it can lead to confusion ,animaciy , misunderstanding or even
  crush a mouty million dollars probe into the surface of malls
- the fact is even when face to face with another person in the very same room and speaking the same language,human
  communication is incredibly complex
- but the good news is that the basic understanding of what happened when you communicate can help us prevent
  mis-communication
- for decades ,researches have asked what happens when we communicate
- one interpertation ,call transmission model ,views communication as a message that moves directly from one person to
  an ,similar to someone talking sth at all and walking away
- but in reality ,this impliscate model doesn't account for communication complexcity
- enter the transaction model which acknowledges that many added challenges of the communicating
- with this model ,it's more accurate to think communication between people as a game of catch
- as we communicate or message, we've received faceback from other party
- through the transaction,we create meaning together
- but from the success change ,forther complication arise
- it's not like the star track universe or some caricter can vocan mind mile , falling sharing froze and feelings
- as humans ,we can't help but send and receive messages through our own subjective lances
- when communicating one person express her interpretation of message and the person she's communicating with,here's his
  own interpretation of that message
- our preception filter continuing shift meaning and interpretations
- remember that game of catch
- imaging it with lomp of clam
- as each person touch as it ,they shape to feed their own unique perception based on any number of variable ,like
  knowledge ,or pass experience, ages, ,race, gender ,asnicity,relation or family background

- sth were you brain says ,rude
- it's not just been blunter seen things that are argue,it's those things that servers no proposes other than to hurt
  and mean others,and we don't have the in l to snap the x

- you dump it,after the smallest down of course,and sth mean it's very fairy
- there're fly up all over the place , setting a light,anyone who come close
- everyone was kindling ,even you're not fire back been in normal
- seriously,the study shows that ongoing interactions like nagociate with rude people increase the other party rudeness
  there after

- it's force the other person to take a pause and provide inside,showing that you're listening and care ,not just get
  swap up in the forst
- benefit for you, knowing the wine,and give you tools and control to make a better decision like virperion
- no2.let's start the conversation over
- it is where the conversation start it off far and more than to argue nearly ankle soon
- many times it's because of the emotions grow until both sides lose empathy for each other
- all either side can seen is you're not thinking of my point of you
- in the hidden of the moment we forget this truth
- my feelings are valid,and there are equally valid which means we forget to consider the answer to this questions

  than exceptible

- or let's just take a few minutes to calm down before it gets worse and come back this later
- you can rewrite this in several weeks ,but you're essentially say if you notice that it's not the best you wanna
  take,and better discussions what's happening before
- this phrase is like a reset button, so you can hopefully reload at a safe point before the conversation turn into
  fight,but it's still have all the progress you may during the compart conversation
- of course,arguing towards yourself like i'm feeling very emotional, i need a settle please ,may work better ,showing
  that you're software and care about others not just press your point , telling you're already a emotional person, you
  need to calm down usually the opposite
- and no5.you need to revaliate the way you speak to people

  pifuny of i never know i came out that way

flight delay
---

- but we began are report with more dangerous air quality
- millions are under alerts
- there you see chicago on the upper lap cover and pains also right here in new york city were 3 weeks ago ,the sky
  turned orange
- the air is fine now,but expect to reach on a health level,nyc thursday
- we have a much more on that in a moment
- meanwhile another day a server whether in the north ways with cast cost,thousands of flight delay and canclation had a
  july forth weekend
- string the passengers have been forced to either pay for a hotel or sleep near the gate
- passenger brace for impact deal to the fight 1092 skit to a stop on its nose ,but sd international airport
- it sounds like a wild start and scrimp of madal
- no one was injected
- and sd apoligize calling the rare corance
- across to company,another type of flight frastration ,delay more than 7000 and cancel nearly 7000 , leaving
- across to company,another type of flight frastration ,so this stores this week for airplane delay more than 37000 and
  cancel nearly 7000 , leaving screw and passengers screned
- from huston to nashnew,nashnew to motomor ,motomor to long
- while trying to stay same
-     most lose is last lage
- exacebate matters ,airline crew ,out of presation and passenger seperate from their luggage
- i have 3 bags and have valuable things in them had gone somewhere,and i have no ideas where they are
- meanwhile customers are left to figure out how to be made a whole again
- as right now,how much conponsition have you been offered
- airline in the us are not required to reinbrith the hotels due to the weather
- travel lines books green books says ,consider traveling insurance
- if you want to get the insurance ,do not upload on the online
- cruel travel get them to work if that policy,or you maybe buy at least in your keys ,words for insurance
- and a,join us at online right now,you know the picture behind you set all and all the people that you spoke with the
  man's frastraiton
- with all the delays and canclelation errors,all ready this week,how the airline and airports are cross the country
  preparing for the upcoming weekends rush
- it's a great question
- i think because of what you see around me .it's less about how airline are preparing ,and more about how they'll re
  plan the fight schedules,with so many palas,flight crews, out of place, passengers ,strengthed,and this focus next
  mile at all ,have flight canceled
- the baggage claim line,they try to find out where the baggage is, if they can get them on hands on it
- one gentleman just told me he is on the hold customers service,5h try to get board of his lejustic
- so the questions now become for airlines,right before we experience thursday,which is expected to be the busiest
  travel the holiday ,we can fight
- it's more about how airline can manigate the lose and risk with so much chaos ,pretifc end with unit state pass
- really all and lines ,feeling this pronch and cronch right now
- absolutely air,you know the fia have more flight into new york ,mutual area,to the summer could be a little bit of
  more chaos than usual, can you explain why that is ?
- i think the fia is trying to manage the expectations
- keep in mind that engency has been with out of pum and admit strength out from number of years
- the temperate is strained right now
- they have had staff issues can control towers
- that has been one component of his reducing,it's ability to do this job
- but they what we have airlines to reduce some of slots into apples and requesting the airlines,fly few plains that
  they can carry more passengers
- the airline try to prepare for this by hiring up during the pandemic
-     it's not forget,many of the airlines are received billions of dollars of funding from the government during the covid
-     and now it's all about trying to demonstrate to pain customers ,you know how frastrate it is trying to get somewhere and have the inability to get you there,it's all about the delivery on that  contract  customers have with the airline
- just a very stress moment for everyone
- only to bring every ounce or patience you can muscle of yourself your friends,your family and everyone you have known
- we'll be touched of this
- you know we're about to that travel life is well
- airport nek with the importance the information to pass your patience from the new libric international airprot
- thank you

negative self talk
---

- how often do you talk this way to yourself
- i'm so *dumb* ,i'm so useless,i'm so ugly
- whatever you're going through,you're not alone
- the way we talk to *ourselves* can either bring energy to our *lives* or *terrorists to*  pieces
- it begins when we are young
- even though our parents love in care deeply about us , they're not perfect ,and *their* own *pain* and *trauma* are
  often passed on us *unintentionally*
- our pain grows when the interaction with others,hurts *us* deeply which *we* *internalize* with negative self talk
- and breaking the *cycle* of harsh ,self *evaluation* can go on for weeks,months,or even years
- and the longer we *criticize* ourselves,the more we feel like we're falling into a deep ,dark,*tunnel*
- but still ,we *remain* strong
- in order to break the negative self talk,we take long walks ,we meditate,we read self-help books to move forward in
  the dark *tunnel*
- and with each step of self-care ,we make progress on the way through the dark *tunnel* of the inner *critic*
- sometimes even for the strongest of us,*it* can feel lonely to keep up with self-care *routines*
- and when everything feels overwhelming,we began to wonder ,is there any *hope* for us after all
- or are we simply doomed to walk alone in this endless *tunnel* of negative self talk
- for there is a *glimpse* of hope
- in these dark and trying times,when we become our own harshest *critic*,when we feel *alone* in the journey,unsure of
  where to go ,*frustrated* with our progress,our loved ones,guide us through the *tunnel* ,helping us navigate through
  the darkness
- in our darkest moments,their presence protect us from own cruel words,and even though you may hurt each other without
  meaning to
- we learn to accept forgive and care
- they remind us that regardless of what happened in the pass,we're not the harsh words we *say* to ourselves
- instead,they remind us that we're loved,we're cared for,and we're worthy
- their words are the *rays* of sunshine that *pierce* through the *thick* *clouds* of self judgement and bring light
  into our darkness
- and the moments when we can't bring up the *courage* to be kind to ourselves ,the only help we have is each other
- because if there *is* just one person that cares ,it *plants* to a *seed* of *assurance* that,maybe,just maybe we're
  not the words that we say to ourselves
- just maybe,we're not defined *by* the ruthless words of our inner *critic*
- so to anyone who may be suffering from negative self-talk and harsh inner *criticism*,you're not alone ,please reach
  out
- and if you feel like there is no one around you,we want to tell you,you're braver than you believe ,stronger than seem
  ,and smarter than you think

ai travel
---

- ai could possibly help you plan your next big trip
- travel company start to *integrate* chatgpt and other ai *tech* into their platform to assist *travelers* with booking
  flights and *crafting* *itinerary*
- *joining* us now for more is jf, *he's the editor-in-chief of* *entrepreneur* *magazine*
- this is surely an entrepreneurial thing ,*but* it could *put some*  entrepreneurs out of business too
- so explain *to us* how this works and if *it has* any limitation
- well,you can put some entrepreneur *out* of business ,it could also create some new entrepreneur
- so let me start with an example
- i'm currently on vacation in bcr,so last night i went on chatgpt and i said, my wife is food *snob* ,which is true,
  she *would admit* herself,i said my wife is food *snob* ,where can i take her for a nice *restaurant* date night in
  bcr
- it came back with six options immediately i show them to my wife she said,not bad, and this is the beginning
- this tools can create entire *itinerary*  for you ,that's the reason why the industry is so interested and they're
  starting to *integrate* chatgpt
- there are a lots of  *startup* doing it ,but also a big player *like Expedia* that are creating chat *bots* ,you can
  uss to plan your next trip
- so that's very interesting use *of* ai
- i was telling ed for spring *break* trip ,i actually might through 3 options are *available*
- we planned *it* ourselves,*but* then we also hire a travel agent
- and i also find the app,there was an ai app to plan the *itinerary* for me ,and *ultimately* we end up *scrapping* the
  travel agent and the ai app *didn't* really *do it* for me
- because part of the joy of getting ready for vacation is the weeks and weeks of planning for me
- so i'd like *doing that work*
- i want to ask you ,why would someone choose to use ai to plan your vacation
- well,it's *efficient*,and let's be clear ,nobody including people who make artificial intelligent tools is saying,this
  is the only thing you need,or it is going to replace everything
- instead ,it's a great tool
- you should think of chatgpt like the microwave in your your *kitchen* which is to say it's an incredibly impressive
  technology
- it can make things very fast ,but you don't make *gourmet meals* with it,you *don't do* everything with it
- and that's the case with this
- so it's fun with play around for example with the prompts
- you know,if you tap in "show me some family friendly vacation ideas in bnc" ,you're going to get a whole *bunch* of
  random *stuff*
- but *if* you start to *be incredibly* specific,i have 2 boys 8 ages and 4 ,they're very energetic and like to run
  around, where can i take them to board in brc
- you might get some good starting points,and then you can use the starting points to do your own research and talk to
  people and do all the things that are really very fun when you're planning travel
- right,so take the *grunt* work out of it ,then you're just left the fun stuff
- no,i like microwave *technology*
- that's a good way of explaining how *all of this ai technology* could *ultimately* help all of us one way ors
  another,*at least* in the a good ways
- there have been of course a lot of delays and *cancellation* lately ,j ,because of the weather ,because of the
  *staffing* issues across the airline industry
- is there any ai technology *yet* *that's* helping the actually assist in rescheduling ,*in* travel or vacation plan
- well ,that *stuff* is starting to come online
- the main things people use with chatgpt is very *literally* far behind because it has a knowledge cut off ,it doesn't
  know things after September of 2021
- so that's  *certainly* not the place you're gonna to get the latest information on how to get out the *travel jam*
- but there are also tools that gonna to do help you identify the right *carriers* or maybe sth to do when you *stuck*
  in al and you don't know where else to go
- but this is a kind of stuff that is coming ,there are very early days,you said the beginning of the segments,there are
  opportunities for entrepreneurs,and i would like to say there are a lot of people how to create solution for just that
- and my *follow-up*  question to you is where *do you* see this going
- yes,it's a early days,but ,you know ,what's next
- a lot of people are predicting that this is kind of staff is gonna put people out of work,and i just don't see that to
  be true
- people predict the end of travel agent since beginning of the internet ,they're still very useful,and the reason for
  that is because we often think new technology as replacing human and *jobs* that not actually what happened
- instead what happens is that it *changes* jobs and it create new opportunities
- so you can *imagine*,a world in which artificial intelligence makes travel more *efficient* to plan ,and because of
  its more *efficient*,cheaper,and because of its cheaper
- more people start traveling ,and because of more people start traveling ,you need more jobs to serve the people who
  are traveling
- so i think we gonna we're gonna to see some changes in the industry,but i don't think that it's *doom and gloom* ,i
  think that a lot of opportunities
- i like that *glasses is half full* perspective my friend ,j,thank you very much
- that's entrepreneurial *spirit* ,i *appreciate your helping*
- it's true

  feel,which was sth i never feel before
- you're entirely order environment to could be a morse and you feel sth ,it's real
- basic the goal is that is overcoming limitation of current vr device,this are often based on revisions,can be quite
  expensive
- this solutions instead can be moved by signals sent tools , and then send it own signals to more closer capture a
  user's movement
- the s is that are often used more exist motions capture for films and games,or to restart the frozen gat,a simple p d
  that require prompts to help patient move
- the cool things is that the access is heated of quite similar human muscle
- it's also the reason why we use them ,because we have a natural feeling when using halso on the suit is very important
  that is similar true to human muscle and some sense

  40 program as aspartame for kilogram are fully wait
- the who release a state saying *quote* safety is the major considered, and the douces which is comely use,x affect
  ,need to be investigate by more and better sadis
- on x o joins us now,he is healthy colnony who writes about food and nutrition for the wst pose

- because as we mentioned the who didn't change its recommendation for our daily intake
- so break down for where the old places you can find this ,and how much we should have
- so aspartame has been around for decades,and it has really exposed in our food supply
